# Lots of Data

So much data. How can we map it fast!

A sample of the data

:::{figure} #nb.lonboard_slider_plot
:label: fig.lonboard_slider_plot
:::

Here's all the data with lonboard-viz

:::{figure} #nb.lonboard_slider_viz
:label: fig.lonboard_slider_viz
:::

And something prettier with sliders

:::{figure} #nb.lonboard_slider
:label: fig.lonboard_slider
:::


Isn't that nice.
