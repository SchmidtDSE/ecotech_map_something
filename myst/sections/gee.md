### Google Earth Engine (GEE)


_\"Google Earth Engine combines a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities.\"_

- https://code.earthengine.google.com   (code editor)

GEE is great repository for data, computation and mapping. Today we'll focus on mapping

You can inspect and run the code for yourself [here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/cbc4e40ca55412fa922de8910849fbb3)

##### GEE APP

Earth Engine also alows you to turn simple scripts like the one above into public facing apps with a few clicks of a button.

[Here](https://dse-ee-playground.projects.earthengine.app/view/ecotech-geeapp-fires-demo) is the resulting app

```

One can go far beyond the simple app above. [Here](https://brookie.users.earthengine.app/view/calfires-explorer) is an example of a more advance app
